        <p>
          Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but
          so does your audience. Create connections with your users as you
          engage in genuine discussion.

            <h2>Grow Together</h2>
            <p>
              Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a
              strong, loyal community. Think of the insightful conversations you
              miss out on with a feedback form.

            <p>
              You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it
              online? Our threads have just-in-time loading for a more natural
              flow.

              It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's
              authentication solution. This means, once signed in to your app,
              your users can start chatting immediately.
